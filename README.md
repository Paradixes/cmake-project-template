# CMake Project Template

> This is a template for CMake projects. It is intended to be used as a starting point for new projects. It uses

    - [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
    - [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
    - [mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik)
- CMakePresets.json is based on the following projects:
    - [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/main)

## Clang

- clang-format is based on the [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) coding standards.
- clang-tidy is based on
  the [Clion](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/articles/CPP-A-90276519/Clang-Tidy-in-CLion:-default-configuration) default
  configuration.
